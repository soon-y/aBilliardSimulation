- Blender; room, a billiard table, pool billiard cues and holder


# 3. Features
- When "Reset Speed" button is clicked, random vectors for velocity are assigned to each ball.
- The speed of each ball drops by 20% when rebounded off cushions. 
- The speed of each ball drops by 20% every second due to friction with the billiard table.
- Adjustable the position, intensity, angle, color of the light, and volume of speed.


# 4. Issues
- Balls sometimes roll over with attached.
